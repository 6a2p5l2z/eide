> #### for the author's test environment is limited, so if you encounter a bug, you are welcome by [github -> issue](https://github.com/github0null/eide/issues) for feedback

> #### Warnings: you should install JLink driver in your PC before use JLink tools

> #### The author is working on a [manual](https://github.com/github0null/eide-doc/blob/master/README.md) that will make it easier to use the plug-in

- ### [v1.1.4]
> Note for burn: if the chip has read protection during burn, the first burn will fail and you need to try again
- repair: unable to reset the chip automatically after burning
- new: project template, export your project framework as template
  - **description** : export project template can be imported into the project from the disk/Github public repository, repository location in the plug-in setting, [the default repository location](https://github.com/github0null/eide-doc)
- new: output `.bin` file
- new: burn and read protection (note: after the read protection is enabled, the automatic reset option will be shielded;Because the automatic reset will trigger the read protection after the burning is completed, resulting in the chip being erased.
- new: automatically set the path to burn files
- add: plugin set 'Convert Axf File To Elf File' : Convert output.axf To.elf after compilation To fit GDB debugger, off by default (this is an experimental feature)
  - **description**: there is a difference in the way image files are linked between.axf (generated by Keil) and.elf (generated by GCC). Therefore, when debugging.axf files with GDB, the ZI segment (uninitialized global variable, static variable) may not be set to 0 correctly. It will be -1

- ### [v1.1.3]
- new: shows compilation timestamp and compilation time
- new: incremental compilation (compiles only files that have been changed), shortcut <kbd>F9</kbd>
- new: automatically generate the debugging configuration of cortex-debug

***
- ### [v1.1.2]
- fixed: the header file could not be found when ARM compiles
- fixed: header search path does not contain root directory
- new: increases timestamp and compilation time for compilation output
- new: editor context menu: manually convert the currently open ANSI file to UTF8 (Keil's default is ANSI, which will be scrambled in vscode)
- new: editor context menu: undo last file encoding conversion
- new: plugin Settings: convert all source files to utf-8 encoding when importing Keil project, turned on by default
- new: the value of the label can be copied to facilitate other operations
- new: add release/debug mode. Switch these modes to automatically add different macros at compile time. Users can customize the list of macros in plug-in Settings

***
- ### [v1.1.1]
- fix: unable to automatically create the dependence directory
- add: link to the LIB file. You can click the 'add LIB' button or manually copy the LIB file to the source directory to complete the LIB addition

***

## Function

* Create and open EIDE project
* Import Keil uVision 5 project and create a new EIDE project for it **( only support Keil uVison 4, 5 )**
* Export Keil project file(.uvprojx, .uvproj) to workspace
* Manage project dependence
* Compile project (if it is a STM32 project, it will generate a launch.json for `stm32-debugger` debugger)
* `If you need a STM32 debugger, you can search `[stm32-debugger](https://github.com/github0null/stm32-debugger/releases)` in extensions market (It combines with EIDE for a better experience)`

***

## Warnings
  + **Chinese words should not exist in the installation path of the plug-in, otherwise it may fail when using the compile function**
  + **Not support debug for C51 project**
